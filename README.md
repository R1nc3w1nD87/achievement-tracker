A simple REST API project.
My goal is to create an API which follows the REST architectual style.
As a start I made sure that my controller (and according classes, e.g. Entity, Service) are working correctly.
Using PostMan I have so far deduced that the code works correctly.
Following will be expansion of the entity, additional entities and additional logic allowing for further functionality.
